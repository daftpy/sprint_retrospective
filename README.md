# Journal 8: Sprint Review
This journal concludes my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course at Southern New Hampshire University.

Throughout this course I gained valuable insights into the following:
* Understanding Agile Team roles
* Familiarity with practices of the Scrum Framework
* Stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
* The craft and purpose of  creating User stories
* Converting user stories into working features
* The importance of building test cases



# Interpreting User's Needs

Interpreting the needs of the user requires us to engage in user research; gather feedback through focus groups or surveys and analyze this data to gain insight into core needs and desires for your users.

Once you identify these needs, they are transformed into a prioritized list of features for development. User stories assist in capturing these user requirements and gives the development team their perspective on how the product is to be used and the expectations around it. Without a user story, two teams might have disagreement on how a feature they must collaborate on behaves. This could lead to buggy software that doesn't work or a feature that doesn't align with the client's vision.

User stories ensure software stays aligned with the end user and promotes clarity among the team where ambiguity might exist.

# Approaching Development

How I will approach program development after this course will change drastically. I will begin with gathering requirements and giving more consideration to my projects architecture.

I will incorporate an Agile approach to this process by implementing iterative development, where I follow a common process of: code, test, deploy. This process will cycle over and over, moving me towards a complete product while allowing me opportunity to navigate change.

I will utilize other strategies like developing user stories and allowing those to guide my feature development. Daily stand ups will also be used when I work collaboratively with others.

Adopting these Agile principles will allow me to be more flexible in my approach to software development while also keeping the end product aligned with the user.

# Being a Good Teammate

To me, being a good team member in software development means having a humble approach to each project. Keeping an open-mind and practicing open communication are essential to succeeding in a diverse team that must evolve with the ever-changing tech-industry. Be willing to communicate your issues and be willing to assist others when they communicate theirs. 

It is easy to fall into your own silo within a tech company, especially in a remote workplace which has become far more common in recent years. Do what you are able to counteract this and maintain consistent and regular communication with your team. By embracing the collaborative nature of our work, we enable each team member to not only meet, but exceed expectations.
